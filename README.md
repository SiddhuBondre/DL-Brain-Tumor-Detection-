# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
# 📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
The goal is to classify MRI scans into different categories (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, no tumor) and assist in early diagnosis.

# 🚀 Features

📂 Handles MRI image dataset with preprocessing and augmentation

🧠 Uses CNN / Transfer Learning (VGG16, ResNet, EfficientNet) for classification

📊 Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

🖼 Visualizes training history and predictions

🌐 Can be deployed as a Flask/Streamlit Web App for doctors/researchers

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.x

TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Learning)

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data analysis & visualization)

OpenCV (Image preprocessing)

Streamlit/Flask (for deployment – optional)
