# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
# ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
The goal is to classify MRI scans into different categories (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, no tumor) and assist in early diagnosis.
